Hi,
 
I’m copying and pasting an email/private piazza post I made here. I sent an email to Dr. Acton, but I just wanted to also put this here just in case, since I'm very worried. We finished our assignment 2 before the deadline and pushed it without any errors, but for some reason when I checked the repository this morning (the day after it was due) one of the classes had random lines like 
"=======“, "<<<<<<< HEAD”, and ">>>>>>> 285bbfad845b01d09f44605363a4a88764ca920b” added to one of the files. These weren’t added by us obviously and they obviously wouldn't be put there for any reason and they make no sense to be in there, so I’m not sure how they got there. The class this is in is very small, and I would only be editing out those three lines of random strings and the edited version can be compared to the old one easily. Without them, the code compiles and works correctly to the best of our knowledge. Would it be possible to erase them or would this lose us points?
 
Edit: actually, on a second look, it looks like three of the methods were duplicated. The random strings separate the duplicated methods. I'm really confused what happened to it... 
Would we be able to roll back to a previous commit of the file (just that file that doesn't compile)? If not, would we lose more points by leaving it as is (not being able to compile) or by fixing it and pushing and losing 33.3%?
 
Edit 2: Since it's the weekend and I haven't received a reply, I'll just fix it and push...
 
Thanks,
 
Mark Pedersen
